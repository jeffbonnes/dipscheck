This is a quick example of how Density Specific Resources are used on Android in Appclerator Titanum.  I did 
because I wanted to understand how big my images needed to be for each device.

Here is the summary:
res-xhdpi (Samsung Galaxy Nexus, Samsung Galaxy S3) - Same as @2x images for iPhone
res-hdpi  (Samsung Galaxy S, Samsung Galaxy S2, HTC Desire HD, HTC Incredible S) - 1.5x size of pixels
res-mdpi  (HTC Desire 2.5) - Same as iPhone images (1px = 1dp)
res-ldpi  (people who need a new phone) - .75x size of pixels
